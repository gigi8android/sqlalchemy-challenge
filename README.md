# sqlalchemy-challenge - Surfs Up!

## Homework submission:

The folder structure in this repository is as followed: </br>
1. Folder "Resources" contains: all the required input csv files and hawaii.sql database
2. Folder "Images" contains: all graphs generated by the jupyter notebooks
3. File _app.py_: is for the Climate App, output to the browser with the requested json data
4. Jupyter notebooks: _climate_final_, _bonus1_temp_analysis_final_ (contains data analysis for June & December) and _bonus2_temp_analysis_final_ (contains daily normals and trip rainfall)

**_Notes:_** </br>
  - The Climate App will open the requested json data link in the client browser's new tab, and it also has a date's checking mechanism to check the user input date/s
  - Python file and Jupyter notebooks are self-contained codes and can be executed independly.
  - Data analysis for June & December based on t-test is embedded in the jupyter notebook _bonus1_temp_analysis_final_, and supported by some additional graphs such as histogram and boxplot.
  - There is discrepancy in the provided homework template and the instructions. The stacked graph for Daily Temperature Normals (refer to file _bonus2_temp_analysis_final_) is generated for the date range as specified in the provided template _temp_analysis_bonus_2_starter.ipynb_, i.e. start_date = '2017-08-01' and end_date = '2017-08-07', rather than in the homework Instruction's image with the date range: 2018-01-01 to 2018-01-07.
